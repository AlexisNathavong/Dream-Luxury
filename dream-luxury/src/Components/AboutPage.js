            <p>My name is Noel Bates and I am the owner of Dream Luxury Rentals. I was born and raised in West Memphis, Arkansas and made my way to Texas 7 years ago. I always had a huge passion for foreign cars since I was a kid, which inspired me to start a luxury rental car business to allow others to experience driving luxury vehicles at a reasonable rate.
